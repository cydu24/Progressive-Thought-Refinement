Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( k \) such that the vectors \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \) and \( 3(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 8(\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + k(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \) are orthogonal. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.
### Step 1: Compute \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \)
Given:
\[
\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -11 \\ 5 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + \sqrt{5} \\ 4 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + (-11) + (1 + \sqrt{5}) \\ 3 + 5 + 4 \\ 0 + 2 + (-5) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -9 + \sqrt{5} \\ 12 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
### Step 2: Compute \( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} \)
\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -11 & 5 & 2 \\ 1 + \sqrt{5} & 4 \\ -5 \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(5 \cdot (-5) - 2 \cdot 4) - \mathbf{j}(-11 \cdot (-5) - 2 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{5})) + \mathbf{k}(-11 \cdot 4 - 5 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{5}))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-25 - 8) - \mathbf{j}(55 - 2 - 2\sqrt{5}) + \mathbf{k}(-44 - 5 - 5\sqrt{5})
\]
\[
= -33\mathbf{i} - (53 - 2\sqrt{5})\mathbf{j} - (49 + 5\sqrt{5})\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} -33 \\ -53 + 2\sqrt{5} \\ -49 - 5\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]
### Step 3: Compute \( \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} \)
\[
\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 + \sqrt{5} & 4 & -5 \\ 1 & 3 & 0 \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(4 \cdot 0 - (-5) \cdot 3) - \mathbf{j}((1 + \sqrt{5}) \cdot 0 - (-5) \cdot 1) + \mathbf{k}((1 + \sqrt{5}) \cdot 3 - 4 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(0 + 15) - \mathbf{j}(0 + 5) + \mathbf{k}(3 + 3\sqrt{5} - 4)
\]
\[
= 15\mathbf{i} - 5\mathbf{j} + (-1 + 3\sqrt{5})\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ -5 \\ -1 + 3\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]
### Step 4: Compute \( \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} \)
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 3 & 0 \\ -11 & 5 & 2 \end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(3 \cdot 2 - 0 \cdot 5) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 2 - 0 \cdot (-11)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot (-11))
\]
\[
= 6\mathbf{i} - 2\mathbf{j} + 38\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -2 \\ 38 \end{pmatrix}
\]
### Step 5: Compute \( 3(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 8(\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + k(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) \)
\[
3(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 3 \begin{pmatrix} -33 \\ -53 + 2\sqrt{5} \\ -49 - 5\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -99 \\ -159 + 6\sqrt{5} \\ -147 - 15\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
-8(\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) = -8 \begin{pmatrix} 15 \\ -5 \\ -1 + 3\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -120 \\ 40 \\ 8 - 24\sqrt{5} \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
k(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = k \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -2 \\ 38 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6k \\ -2k \\ 38k \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
3(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 8(\mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}) + k(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = \begin{pmatrix} -99 - 120 + 6k \\ -159 + 6\sqrt{5} + 40 - 2k \\ -147 - 15\sqrt{5} + 8 - 24\sqrt{5} + 38k \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} -219 + 6k \\ -119 + 6\sqrt{5} - 2k \\ -139 - 39\sqrt{5} + 38k \end{pmatrix}
\]
### Step 6: Compute the dot product with \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} \)
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -9 + \sqrt{5} \\ 12 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} -219 + 6k \\ -119 + 6\sqrt{5} - 2k \\ -139 - 39\sqrt{5} + 38k \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]
\[
(-9 + \sqrt{5})(-219 + 6k) + 12(-119 + 6\sqrt{5} - 2k) + (-3)(-139 - 39\sqrt{5} + 38k) = 0
\]
Expanding each term:
\[
(-9)(-219) + (-9)(6k) + \sqrt{5}(-219) + \sqrt{5}(6k) + 12(-119) + 12(6\sqrt{5}) + 12(-2k) + (-3)(-139) + (-3)(-39\sqrt{5}) + (-3)(38k) = 0
\]
\[
1971 - 54k - 219\sqrt{5} + 6k\sqrt{5} - 1428 + 72\sqrt{5} - 24k + 417 + 117\sqrt{5} - 114k = 0
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(1971 - 1428 + 417) + (-54k - 24k - 114k) + (-219\sqrt{5} + 72\sqrt{5} + 117\sqrt{5}) + 6k\sqrt{5} = 0
\]
\[
960 - 192k - 30\sqrt{5} + 6k\sqrt{5} = 0
\]
### Step 7: Solve for \( k \)
\[
960 - 192k - 30\sqrt{5} + 6k\sqrt{5} = 0
\]
\[
960 - 30\sqrt{5} = 192k - 6k\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
960 - 30\sqrt{5} = k(192 - 6\sqrt{5})
\]
\[
k = \frac{960 - 30\sqrt{5}}{192 - 6\sqrt{5}}
\]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[
k = \frac{(960 - 30\sqrt{5})(192 + 6\sqrt{5})}{(192 - 6\sqrt{5})(192 + 6\sqrt{5})}
\]
\[
k = \frac{960 \cdot 192 + 960 \cdot 6\sqrt{5} - 30\sqrt{5} \cdot 192 - 30\sqrt{5} \cdot 6\sqrt{5}}{192^2 - (6\sqrt{5})^2}
\]
\[
k = \frac{184320 + 5760\sqrt{5} - 5760\sqrt{5} - 900 \cdot 5}{36864 - 180}
\]
\[
k = \frac{184320 - 4500}{36684}
\]
\[
k = \frac{179820}{36684}
\]
\[
k = \frac{179820 \div 12}{36684 \div 12} = \frac{14985}{3057}
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
k = \frac{14985 \div 3}{3057 \div 3} = \frac{4995}{1019}
\]
Answer: 
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{4995}{1019}}
\]


Question: Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.\n\nHow many different primes appear in the prime factorization of $20!$ (20 factorial)? (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after \"Answer:\", and you do not need to use a \\boxed command.
Answer: 1. First, recall the prime factorization concept:
   - To find the prime factors of \(n!\), we need to consider all prime numbers \(p\) such that \(p\leq n\).
   - For \(n = 20\), we need to find all prime numbers \(p\) with \(p\leq20\).
   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.
   - Start listing prime numbers:
     - The prime numbers less than or equal to 20 are found by checking each number from 2 to 20.
     - 2 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 2.
     - 3 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 3.
     - 4 is not a prime number because \(4 = 2\times2\).
     - 5 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 5.
     - 6 is not a prime number because \(6=2\times3\).
     - 7 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 7.
     - 8 is not a prime number because \(8 = 2\times2\times2\).
     - 9 is not a prime number because \(9=3\times3\).
     - 10 is not a prime number because \(10 = 2\times5\).
     - 11 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 11.
     - 12 is not a prime number because \(12=2\times2\times3\).
     - 13 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 13.
     - 14 is not a prime number because \(14 = 2\times7\).
     - 15 is not a prime number because \(15=3\times5\).
     - 16 is not a prime number because \(16 = 2\times2\times2\times2\).
     - 17 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 17.
     - 18 is not a prime number because \(18=2\times3\times3\).
     - 19 is a prime number since its only positive divisors are 1 and 19.
     - 20 is not a prime number because \(20 = 2\times2\times5\).
2. Then, count the number of distinct prime numbers:
   - The distinct prime numbers less than or equal to 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.
   - Counting these prime numbers, we find that there are 8 of them.
Answer: \[
\\boxed{8}

Question: Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.\n\nIn the NBA in 2003, Yao Ming was one of the tallest players at $7'5''$. Earl Boykins was the shortest player at $5'5''$. How many inches taller than Boykins was Ming?\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after \"Answer:\", and you do not need to use a \\boxed command.
Answer: First, we need to solve the problem of calculating how many inches taller Yao Ming is than Earl Boykins.
We know that Yao Ming's height is 7'5'' and Earl Boykins' height is 5'5''.
Since we want to calculate the height difference, we need to convert both of their heights to inches first.
Because 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, for Yao Ming's height of 7'5'':
First, calculate the number of inches in 7 feet, which is 7 multiplied by 12, getting 84 inches. Then add the additional 5 inches. So Yao Ming's height in inches is 84 + 5 = 89 inches.
For Earl Boykins' height of 5'5'':
Similarly, first calculate the number of inches in 5 feet, which is 5 multiplied by 12, getting 60 inches. Then add the additional 5 inches. So Earl Boykins' height in inches is 60 + 5 = 65 inches.
Now that both of their heights are in inches, to find out how many inches taller Yao Ming is than Earl Boykins,
we just need to subtract Earl Boykins' height (65 inches) from Yao Ming's height (89 inches), that is 89 - 65 = 24 inches.
So the final answer is that Yao Ming is 24 inches taller than Earl Boykins.
Answer: \[
\\boxed{24}

Question: Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.\n\nIn coordinate space, $A = (-2,3,5),$ $B = (7,0,-1),$ $C = (-3,-2,-5),$ and $D = (3,4,7).$  Find the intersection point of lines $AB$ and $CD.$\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after \"Answer:\", and you do not need to use a \\boxed command.
Answer: # 1. First, find the parametric equations of line AB:
# Calculate vector AB. The coordinates of vector AB are obtained by subtracting the coordinates of the starting point A from the coordinates of the ending point B.
# Given A = (-2, 3, 5) and B = (7, 0, -1), then vector AB = <7 - (-2), 0 - 3, -1 - 5> = <9, -3, -6>
# Let A = (-2, 3, 5) be a point on line AB. The parametric equations of line AB are:
# x = -2 + 9t, y = 3 - 3t, z = 5 - 6t, where t ∈ R

# 2. Then, find the parametric equations of line CD:
# Calculate vector CD. The coordinates of vector CD are obtained by subtracting the coordinates of the starting point C from the coordinates of the ending point D.
# Given C = (-3, -2, -5) and D = (3, 4, 7), then vector CD = <3 - (-3), 4 - (-2), 7 - (-5)> = <6, 6, 12>
# Let C = (-3, -2, -5) be a point on line CD. The parametric equations of line CD are:
# x = -3 + 6s, y = -2 + 6s, z = -5 + 12s, where s ∈ R

# 3. Now, set the x, y, and z coordinates equal to each other to solve:
# Set the x-coordinates equal: -2 + 9t = -3 + 6s, which can be rewritten as 9t - 6s = -1 (Equation 1)
# Set the y-coordinates equal: 3 - 3t = -2 + 6s, which can be rewritten as -3t - 6s = -5 (Equation 2)
# Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
# (9t - 6s) - (-3t - 6s) = -1 - (-5)
# Expand to get 9t - 6s + 3t + 6s = -1 + 5
# Combine like terms to get 12t = 4, so t = 4/12 = 1/3
# Substitute t = 1/3 into Equation 2:
# -3×(1/3) - 6s = -5
# Calculate to get -1 - 6s = -5
# Move the terms to get -6s = -5 + 1 = -4, so s = -4/(-6) = 2/3

# 4. Next, check the z-coordinates:
# For line AB, when t = 1/3, z = 5 - 6×(1/3) = 5 - 2 = 3
# For line CD, when s = 2/3, z = -5 + 12×(2/3) = -5 + 8 = 3

# 5. Finally, find the intersection point:
# Substitute t = 1/3 into the parametric equations of line AB (or substitute s = 2/3 into the parametric equations of line CD)
# When t = 1/3, x = -2 + 9×(1/3) = -2 + 3 = 1
# y = 3 - 3×(1/3) = 3 - 1 = 2
# z = 3
# The coordinates of the intersection point are (1, 2, 3)
Answer: \[
\\boxed{(1, 2, 3)}

Question: Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.\n\nIf the mean (average) of five consecutive integers is $21,$ what is the smallest of the five integers?\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after \"Answer:\", and you do not need to use a \\boxed command.
Answer: 1. Let the smallest of the five consecutive integers be \(x\).
   - Then the five consecutive integers are \(x\), \(x + 1\), \(x+2\), \(x + 3\), and \(x + 4\).
2. Recall the formula for the mean (average) of a set of numbers:
   - The mean of a set of numbers \(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n\) is \(\bar{a}=\frac{a_1 + a_2+\cdots+a_n}{n}\).
   - Here, \(n = 5\), and the numbers are \(x\), \(x + 1\), \(x+2\), \(x + 3\), \(x + 4\), and the mean \(\bar{a}=21\).
   - So, \(\frac{x+(x + 1)+(x+2)+(x + 3)+(x + 4)}{5}=21\).
3. Simplify the numerator:
   - Combine like terms in the numerator: \(x+(x + 1)+(x+2)+(x + 3)+(x + 4)=5x+(1 + 2+3 + 4)\).
   - Since \(1+2+3 + 4=\frac{4\times(4 + 1)}{2}=10\) (using the sum of an arithmetic series formula \(S_n=\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}\), where \(n = 4\), \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_n=4\)), the equation becomes \(\frac{5x+10}{5}=21\).
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   - \(\frac{5x+10}{5}=\frac{5x}{5}+\frac{10}{5}=x + 2\).
   - So, \(x + 2=21\).
5. Solve for \(x\):
   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation \(x+2 = 21\).
   - We get \(x=21 - 2=19\).
Answer: \[
\\boxed{19}
\]
